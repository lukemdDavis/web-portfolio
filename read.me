-purpose 

--The purpose of my website was to begin my career as a Jnr Dev
  and Demonstrate skills that I have learnt over the past
   few weeks and apply them to my website.
    My efforts will validate my abilities to build and construct
     a fully functional working website, thus showing my future
      employers that I have the necessary knowledge to impress
       my future tech company.
